        This is a rest API project that uses Nodejs, express and Mongodb.<br />
        The project uses two request routers, one for users and one for business
        cards.<br />
        The request types that it can process are specified in the reqeusts.rest
        file that is located in the routes folder, as well as in each router
        file.<br />
        The database starts off with 3 users and cards upon initialization by
        using the inditDB function.<br />
        Some requests require the correct authorization such as being a business
        account or admin for example.<br />
